ERDAS ECW/JP2 Desktop Read-Only Redistributable SDK License Agreement

IMPORTANT - READ CAREFULLY: This ERDAS ECW/JP2 Desktop Read-Only
Redistributable SDK License Agreement ("License Agreement") is a legal
agreement between You (either an individual or a single legal entity)
and Intergraph Corporation d/b/a Security, Government & Infrastructure
Division (``Intergraph''), for the SDK delivered with this License
Agreement. By installing, copying, downloading, accessing or otherwise
using the SDK, You agree to be bound by the terms of this License
Agreement, which shall take precedence over any other document and shall
govern Your use of the SDK. If You do not agree to the terms of this
License Agreement, do not install or use the SDK.  You agree that this
License Agreement is enforceable against You the same as any written,
negotiated contract signed by You.  If You do not agree to the terms of
this License Agreement, You are not authorized to, and You shall not,
download, install or use the SDK.

 1.	DEFINITIONS

 1.1.	``Decode'' means to view files compressed either using ECW or
JPEG2000 technology.

 1.2.	``Desktop Application'' means desktop software products that You
develop and that permit an end-user to Decode (among other functionality
You develop), and that are intended to be used as self-contained
programs for displaying and processing imagery on the same computing
device.

 1.3.	``ECW'' stands for Enhanced Compressed Wavelet.

 1.4.	``ECWP'' is the Enhanced Compressed Wavelet Protocol, by which ECW
and JPEG2000 files residing on a Server may be streamed to a Desktop
Application and Decoded using the SDK.

 1.5.	``Encode'' means to compress data using ECW technology or to
otherwise compress using the SDK.

 1.6.	 ``Library'' means file of computing functions, compiled, linked,
and saved separately from the processes that use them, intended for use
by programmers in connection with their development of applications that
use the library.

 1.7.	``SDK'' means the Software Development Kit, that is, the set of
software development tools designed to facilitate development of Desktop
Applications using the SDK technologies, currently marketed and licensed
by Intergraph as ECW/JP2 Desktop Read-Only Redistributable SDK, version
5.0 or higher, consisting of libraries and supporting documents designed
to enable You to write software that enables You as the end-user to
Decode files but not to Encode files.  Among other things, the SDK
enables reading ECWP streams and enables decompression of files having
an *.ecw and *.jp2 extension.  The SDK includes the computer software,
object code copy and all contents of the files, disks, CD-ROMs or other
media with which this License Agreement is provided, including any
templates, printed materials, and online or electronic documentation,
all copies, and any modified versions, enhancements, fixes, patches,
updates,  and upgrades of the SDK, if any, licensed to You by
Intergraph, unless a particular modified version, enhancement, fix,
patch, update,  or upgrade is accompanied by a different license
agreement, in which case that license shall apply in accordance with its
terms.  No source code is included with the SDK.

 1.8.	``Server'' means a computing device in a network that is used to
provide services (such as access to files or shared peripherals or any
other computing function) to other computing devices in the network.

 1.9.	``Server Application'' means software products that You develop or
maintain and are capable of running on a Server to provide an image
decoding or processing capability. This License Agreement does not
authorize You to use the SDK to create Server Applications.

 2.	 LICENSE TO CREATE DESKTOP APPLICATIONS; PROHIBITED DEVELOPMENT;
APPLICABILITY TO UPGRADES; NO SUPPORT OBLIGATION

 2.1.	Subject to Your ongoing compliance with all of the terms of this
License Agreement, You are hereby granted a nonexclusive, limited,
royalty-free license to use the SDK to create, use and distribute a
Desktop Application that Decodes files of any size but does not Encode.
You assume full responsibility for the implementation of the SDK to
achieve Your intended results, and for the installation, use and results
obtained from the SDK.

 2.2.	For avoidance of doubt, this License Agreement does not permit You
to (a) create and distribute Server Applications that include the SDK;
or; (b) distribute files that are not included in the
``redistributables'' directory of the SDK.

 2.3.	This Agreement applies to the original SDK received by You, and to
any bug fixes, updates, upgrades, modifications or enhancements provided
to You by Intergraph, unless a particular bug fix, update, upgrade,
modification or enhancement is accompanied by a different license
agreement, in which case that license shall apply in accordance with its
terms.

 2.4.	This License Agreement does not entitle You to, and Intergraph
undertakes no obligation to provide, maintenance, support, modified
versions, enhancements, fixes, patches, updates, and upgrades to the
SDK.  Any support, maintenance or similar services that Intergraph makes
available would be provided under a separate agreement.

 2.5.	You may make one copy of the SDK media in machine readable or
printed form and solely for backup purposes.  Intergraph retains
ownership of all created copies.  You may not transfer the rights to a
backup copy unless you transfer all rights in the SDK and license as
provided for in Section 2.6.

 2.6.	You may transfer the SDK and license within Your company
(intra-company transfer), subject to the Intergraph Security, Government
& Infrastructure Software Transfer Policy (``SG&I Software Transfer
Policy'') and the terms of this License Agreement.  The SG&I Software
Transfer Policy is available from Intergraph upon request.  If You
transfer the SDK, You must at the same time either transfer all copies,
modifications, or merged portions, in whatever form, to the same party,
or You must destroy those not transferred

  3.	OBLIGATIONS AND RESTRICTIONS

 3.1.	Obligation to Support Both ECW and ECWP Read. You agree to: (i)
support ECW files within your Desktop Application as well as the reading
of ECWP streams so that each of Your Desktop Applications is capable of
displaying the ECW-format data and receiving streamed, compressed files
that adhere to the ECWP; and (ii) Your Desktop Applications must provide
a means for specifying or selecting an ECWP stream that is consistent
with the means for specifying or selecting other data sources in the
Desktop Application.  That is, if You create or distribute Desktop
Applications, each of those Desktop Applications must read ECW data and
ECWP streams and must allow a user to access the ECW data and ECWP
streams conveniently, with no more steps than is typical for access to
other data formats in Your Desktop Application.

 3.2.	No Reverse Engineering or Source Code Distribution.  Components of
the SDK used in Desktop Applications may be distributed for use in Your
organization only in object code or executable form. You shall not
decompile, disassemble or otherwise reverse-engineer the SDK in an
attempt to discover its source code, or distribute any source code of
the SDK.  Likewise, You must inform Your organizational end-users of the
prohibition from reverse-engineering the SDK.

 3.3.	License Requirements for Desktop Applications Created Using the
SDK. You shall distribute each of Your Desktop Applications to end-users
pursuant to a conspicuous, legally enforceable end-user license that
provides Intergraph with substantially the same protections as set forth
in Appendix A hereto.  You agree to take all necessary steps to ensure
the legal enforceability of the end-user license, including, as
appropriate: (i) offering a refund of at least a portion of the purchase
price of Your Desktop Applications to end-users who disagree with the
terms of the end-user license including the terms set forth in Appendix
A; or (ii) preventing downloading of Desktop Applications without
acceptance of the end-user license.  You also agree to take adequate
steps to prevent unauthorized use of the SDK or its derivatives by end
users who decline the end-user license offer, such as by disabling
access to Your Desktop Application or preventing access to features made
possible by the SDK, including Encoding or Decoding in Your Desktop
Application.

 3.4.	Intergraph Proprietary Rights Notice. You must include the
following statement of ownership/copyright notice in the ``About'' box
for each of Your Desktop Applications, or any other similar location
where You place proprietary rights notices pertaining to third party
software incorporated in the Desktop Application:

``This application supports the ECW data format and ECWP compression
protocols.  Portions of this computer program are Copyright 2007-2013
Intergraph Corporation. All rights reserved.  Creating compressed files
using ECW technology is protected by one or more of U.S. Patent No.

 3.5.	Prohibition of other actions not explicitly permitted.  You are
not licensed to, and You agree to refrain from, any use, copying, or
distribution of the SDK, or the creation of derivative works thereof,
not explicitly permitted under this License Agreement and will pass on
this prohibition to Your end-users.

 3.6.	High Risk Use.  The SDK is not one hundred percent (100%)
fault-tolerant.  The SDK is not designed or intended for use in any
situation where failure or fault of any kind of the SDK could lead to
death or serious bodily injury of any person, or to severe physical,
property or environmental damage (``High Risk Use''). You are not
licensed to use the SDK in, or in conjunction with, any High Risk Use.
High Risk Use is STRICTLY PROHIBITED. High Risk Use includes, for
example, the following: operation of aircraft or other modes of human
mass transportation, nuclear or chemical facilities, and Class III
medical devices. You hereby agree not to use the SDK in, or in
connection with, any High Risk Use.

  3.7.	Hold Harmless. You shall hold harmless Intergraph from and
against any claims or lawsuits which arise or result from Your use of
the SDK, and/or the use or distribution of any Desktop Applications,
whether authorized under this License Agreement or not.

 4.	TERM AND TERMINATION

 4.1.	Term. The term of this License Agreement commences when you
install or use the SDK, and will extend until terminated.  You may
terminate this License Agreement at any time by permanently destroying
the SDK together with all copies, modifications and merged portions in
any form.  Intergraph may also immediately terminate this License
Agreement if You fail to comply with the terms and conditions of this
License Agreement, or if You fail to pay the appropriate license fees.
You agree upon the termination of this License Agreement to cease using
and to permanently destroy the SDK.

  4.2.	Termination for Breach. If You materially breach this License
Agreement and fail to cure that breach to Intergraph's satisfaction
within thirty (30) days after receiving written notice of the breach,
Intergraph shall have the right to terminate this License Agreement any
time after the end of such period.  Termination shall be without
prejudice to Intergraph's right to seek other redress, such as damages
or injunctive relief, for breach of this License Agreement.

 4.3.	Survival Provisions. Notwithstanding termination of this License
Agreement, Intergraph shall enjoy freedom from liability under Section
8; and Your liabilities for past breaches and Your hold harmless
obligations under Section 3.7 shall also survive.

 4.4.	Obligations Upon Termination. Upon termination of this License
Agreement, all licenses shall terminate and You must return to
Intergraph or destroy all copies of the SDK (and any copies,
modifications and merged portions of the SDK in any form, and all of the
component parts of the SDK) that are in Your possession, custody, or
control.

 5.	INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY.

and at a standard as if the claim is made against You. You shall
reimburse Intergraph any defense expenses inclusive of reasonable
attorneys' fees expended by Intergraph in defense of said claim, and pay
any judgment rendered against Intergraph. You shall make such defense by
counsel of Your choosing and Intergraph shall reasonably cooperate with
said counsel at Your sole cost and expense. You shall have sole control
of said defense, but You shall allow Intergraph to reasonably
participate in its own defense and You shall reasonably cooperate with
Intergraph with respect to the settlement of any claim.  Notwithstanding
the foregoing, Intergraph may at any time decide to take over any
defense of Intergraph at Intergraph's cost and expense and You shall
render full cooperation and assistance to transfer such defense to
Intergraph and with respect to such defense.
