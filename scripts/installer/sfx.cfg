<h3 style="text-align: center;">GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE</h3>
<p style="text-align: center;">Version 3, 29 June 2007</p>

<p>Copyright &copy; 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
 &lt;<a href="https://fsf.org/">https://fsf.org/</a>&gt;</p><p>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.</p>

<h3><a name="preamble"></a>Preamble</h3>

<p>The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works.</p>

<p>The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to
your programs, too.</p>

<p>When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.</p>

<p>To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.</p>

<p>For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive
or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they
know their rights.</p>

<p>Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.</p>

<p>For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and
authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
authors of previous versions.</p>

<p>Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of
protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic
pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to
use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we
have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those
products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we
stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions
of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.</p>

<p>Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that
patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.</p>

<p>The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.</p>

<h3><a name="terms"></a>TERMS AND CONDITIONS</h3>

<h4><a name="section0"></a>0. Definitions.</h4>

<p>&ldquo;This License&rdquo; refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Copyright&rdquo; also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
works, such as semiconductor masks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Program&rdquo; refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
License.  Each licensee is addressed as &ldquo;you&rdquo;.  &ldquo;Licensees&rdquo; and
&ldquo;recipients&rdquo; may be individuals or organizations.</p>

<p>To &ldquo;modify&rdquo; a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
exact copy.  The resulting work is called a &ldquo;modified version&rdquo; of the
earlier work or a work &ldquo;based on&rdquo; the earlier work.</p>

<p>A &ldquo;covered work&rdquo; means either the unmodified Program or a work based
on the Program.</p>

<p>To &ldquo;propagate&rdquo; a work means to do anything with it that, without
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
public, and in some countries other activities as well.</p>

<p>To &ldquo;convey&rdquo; a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.</p>

<p>An interactive user interface displays &ldquo;Appropriate Legal Notices&rdquo;
to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.</p>

<h4><a name="section1"></a>1. Source Code.</h4>

<p>The &ldquo;source code&rdquo; for a work means the preferred form of the work
for making modifications to it.  &ldquo;Object code&rdquo; means any non-source
form of a work.</p>

<p>A &ldquo;Standard Interface&rdquo; means an interface that either is an official
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
is widely used among developers working in that language.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;System Libraries&rdquo; of an executable work include anything, other
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
&ldquo;Major Component&rdquo;, in this context, means a major essential component
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;Corresponding Source&rdquo; for a work in object code form means all
the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's
System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
includes interface definition files associated with source files for
the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
subprograms and other parts of the work.</p>

<p>The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
Source.</p>

<p>The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
same work.</p>

<h4><a name="section2"></a>2. Basic Permissions.</h4>

<p>All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.</p>

<p>You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works
for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.</p>

<p>Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
makes it unnecessary.</p>

<h4><a name="section3"></a>3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.</h4>

<p>No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
measures.</p>

<p>When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's
users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
technological measures.</p>

<h4><a name="section4"></a>4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.</h4>

<p>You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.</p>

<p>You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.</p>

<h4><a name="section5"></a>5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.</h4>

<p>You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:</p>

<ul>
<li>a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
    it, and giving a relevant date.</li>

<li>b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
    released under this License and any conditions added under section
    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
    &ldquo;keep intact all notices&rdquo;.</li>

<li>c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.</li>

<li>d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
    work need not make them do so.</li>
</ul>

<p>A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
&ldquo;aggregate&rdquo; if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
parts of the aggregate.</p>

<h4><a name="section6"></a>6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.</h4>

<p>You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
in one of these ways:</p>

<ul>
<li>a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
    customarily used for software interchange.</li>

<li>b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.</li>

<li>c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
    with subsection 6b.</li>

<li>d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to
    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the
    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.</li>

<li>e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
    charge under subsection 6d.</li>
</ul>

<p>A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
included in conveying the object code work.</p>

<p>A &ldquo;User Product&rdquo; is either (1) a &ldquo;consumer product&rdquo;, which means any
tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular
product received by a particular user, &ldquo;normally used&rdquo; refers to a
typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product
is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
the only significant mode of use of the product.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Installation Information&rdquo; for a User Product means any methods,
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must
suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
modification has been made.</p>

<p>If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply
if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
been installed in ROM).</p>

<p>The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a
network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
protocols for communication across the network.</p>

<p>Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
source code form), and must require no special password or key for
unpacking, reading or copying.</p>

<h4><a name="section7"></a>7. Additional Terms.</h4>

<p>&ldquo;Additional permissions&rdquo; are terms that supplement the terms of this
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
this License without regard to the additional permissions.</p>

<p>When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of
that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:</p>

<ul>
<li>a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or</li>

<li>b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
    Notices displayed by works containing it; or</li>

<li>c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or</li>

<li>d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
    authors of the material; or</li>

<li>e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or</li>

<li>f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of
    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for
    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
    those licensors and authors.</li>
</ul>

<p>All other non-permissive additional terms are considered &ldquo;further
restrictions&rdquo; within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
governed by this License along with a term that is a further
restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains
a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
not survive such relicensing or conveying.</p>

<p>If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
where to find the applicable terms.</p>

<p>Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
the above requirements apply either way.</p>

<h4><a name="section8"></a>8. Termination.</h4>

<p>You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
paragraph of section 11).</p>

<p>However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
prior to 60 days after the cessation.</p>

<p>Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
your receipt of the notice.</p>

<p>Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
material under section 10.</p>

<h4><a name="section9"></a>9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.</h4>

<p>You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do
not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.</p>

<h4><a name="section10"></a>10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.</h4>

<p>Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.</p>

<p>An &ldquo;entity transaction&rdquo; is a transaction transferring control of an
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could
give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.</p>

<p>You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may
not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.</p>

<h4><a name="section11"></a>11. Patents.</h4>

<p>A &ldquo;contributor&rdquo; is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
work thus licensed is called the contributor's &ldquo;contributor version&rdquo;.</p>

<p>A contributor's &ldquo;essential patent claims&rdquo; are all patent claims
owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For
purposes of this definition, &ldquo;control&rdquo; includes the right to grant
patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
this License.</p>

<p>Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
propagate the contents of its contributor version.</p>

<p>In the following three paragraphs, a &ldquo;patent license&rdquo; is any express
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
sue for patent infringement).  To &ldquo;grant&rdquo; such a patent license to a
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
patent against the party.</p>

<p>If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
license to downstream recipients.  &ldquo;Knowingly relying&rdquo; means you have
actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work
in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
country that you have reason to believe are valid.</p>

<p>If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
work and works based on it.</p>

<p>A patent license is &ldquo;discriminatory&rdquo; if it does not include within
the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered
work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment
to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.</p>

<p>Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.</p>

<h4><a name="section12"></a>12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.</h4>

<p>If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a
covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.</p>

<h4><a name="section13"></a>13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.</h4>

<p>Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single
combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this
License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,
section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the
combination as such.</p>

<h4><a name="section14"></a>14. Revised Versions of this License.</h4>

<p>The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.</p>

<p>Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General
Public License &ldquo;or any later version&rdquo; applies to it, you have the
option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered
version or of any later version published by the Free Software
Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the
GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published
by the Free Software Foundation.</p>

<p>If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's
public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you
to choose that version for the Program.</p>

<p>Later license versions may give you additional or different
permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
later version.</p>

<h4><a name="section15"></a>15. Disclaimer of Warranty.</h4>

<p>THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &ldquo;AS IS&rdquo; WITHOUT WARRANTY
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.</p>

<h4><a name="section16"></a>16. Limitation of Liability.</h4>

<p>IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
SUCH DAMAGES.</p>

<h4><a name="section17"></a>17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.</h4>

<p>If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
copy of the Program in return for a fee.</p>

<p>END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS</p>

<h3><a name="howto"></a>How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs</h3>

<p>If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.</p>

<p>To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the &ldquo;copyright&rdquo; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.</p>

<pre>    &lt;one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;
    Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;

    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
    along with this program.  If not, see &lt;https://www.gnu.org/licenses/&gt;.
</pre>

<p>Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.</p>

<p>If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short
notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:</p>

<pre>    &lt;program&gt;  Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;
    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
</pre>

<p>The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands
might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an &ldquo;about box&rdquo;.</p>

<p>You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,
if any, to sign a &ldquo;copyright disclaimer&rdquo; for the program, if necessary.
For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see
&lt;<a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/">https://www.gnu.org/licenses/</a>&gt;.</p>

<p>The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you
may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with
the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General
Public License instead of this License.  But first, please read
&lt;<a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/why-not-lgpl.html">https://www.gnu.org/licenses/why-not-lgpl.html</a>&gt;.</p>

ERDAS ECW/JP2 Desktop Read-Only Redistributable SDK License Agreement

IMPORTANT - READ CAREFULLY: This ERDAS ECW/JP2 Desktop Read-Only
Redistributable SDK License Agreement ("License Agreement") is a legal
agreement between You (either an individual or a single legal entity)
and Intergraph Corporation d/b/a Security, Government & Infrastructure
Division (``Intergraph''), for the SDK delivered with this License
Agreement. By installing, copying, downloading, accessing or otherwise
using the SDK, You agree to be bound by the terms of this License
Agreement, which shall take precedence over any other document and shall
govern Your use of the SDK. If You do not agree to the terms of this
License Agreement, do not install or use the SDK.  You agree that this
License Agreement is enforceable against You the same as any written,
negotiated contract signed by You.  If You do not agree to the terms of
this License Agreement, You are not authorized to, and You shall not,
download, install or use the SDK.

 1.	DEFINITIONS

 1.1.	``Decode'' means to view files compressed either using ECW or
JPEG2000 technology.

 1.2.	``Desktop Application'' means desktop software products that You
develop and that permit an end-user to Decode (among other functionality
You develop), and that are intended to be used as self-contained
programs for displaying and processing imagery on the same computing
device.

 1.3.	``ECW'' stands for Enhanced Compressed Wavelet.

 1.4.	``ECWP'' is the Enhanced Compressed Wavelet Protocol, by which ECW
and JPEG2000 files residing on a Server may be streamed to a Desktop
Application and Decoded using the SDK.

 1.5.	``Encode'' means to compress data using ECW technology or to
otherwise compress using the SDK.

 1.6.	 ``Library'' means file of computing functions, compiled, linked,
and saved separately from the processes that use them, intended for use
by programmers in connection with their development of applications that
use the library.

 1.7.	``SDK'' means the Software Development Kit, that is, the set of
software development tools designed to facilitate development of Desktop
Applications using the SDK technologies, currently marketed and licensed
by Intergraph as ECW/JP2 Desktop Read-Only Redistributable SDK, version
5.0 or higher, consisting of libraries and supporting documents designed
to enable You to write software that enables You as the end-user to
Decode files but not to Encode files.  Among other things, the SDK
enables reading ECWP streams and enables decompression of files having
an *.ecw and *.jp2 extension.  The SDK includes the computer software,
object code copy and all contents of the files, disks, CD-ROMs or other
media with which this License Agreement is provided, including any
templates, printed materials, and online or electronic documentation,
all copies, and any modified versions, enhancements, fixes, patches,
updates,  and upgrades of the SDK, if any, licensed to You by
Intergraph, unless a particular modified version, enhancement, fix,
patch, update,  or upgrade is accompanied by a different license
agreement, in which case that license shall apply in accordance with its
terms.  No source code is included with the SDK.

 1.8.	``Server'' means a computing device in a network that is used to
provide services (such as access to files or shared peripherals or any
other computing function) to other computing devices in the network.

 1.9.	``Server Application'' means software products that You develop or
maintain and are capable of running on a Server to provide an image
decoding or processing capability. This License Agreement does not
authorize You to use the SDK to create Server Applications.

 2.	 LICENSE TO CREATE DESKTOP APPLICATIONS; PROHIBITED DEVELOPMENT;
APPLICABILITY TO UPGRADES; NO SUPPORT OBLIGATION

 2.1.	Subject to Your ongoing compliance with all of the terms of this
License Agreement, You are hereby granted a nonexclusive, limited,
royalty-free license to use the SDK to create, use and distribute a
Desktop Application that Decodes files of any size but does not Encode.
You assume full responsibility for the implementation of the SDK to
achieve Your intended results, and for the installation, use and results
obtained from the SDK.

 2.2.	For avoidance of doubt, this License Agreement does not permit You
to (a) create and distribute Server Applications that include the SDK;
or; (b) distribute files that are not included in the
``redistributables'' directory of the SDK.

 2.3.	This Agreement applies to the original SDK received by You, and to
any bug fixes, updates, upgrades, modifications or enhancements provided
to You by Intergraph, unless a particular bug fix, update, upgrade,
modification or enhancement is accompanied by a different license
agreement, in which case that license shall apply in accordance with its
terms.

 2.4.	This License Agreement does not entitle You to, and Intergraph
undertakes no obligation to provide, maintenance, support, modified
versions, enhancements, fixes, patches, updates, and upgrades to the
SDK.  Any support, maintenance or similar services that Intergraph makes
available would be provided under a separate agreement.

 2.5.	You may make one copy of the SDK media in machine readable or
printed form and solely for backup purposes.  Intergraph retains
ownership of all created copies.  You may not transfer the rights to a
backup copy unless you transfer all rights in the SDK and license as
provided for in Section 2.6.

 2.6.	You may transfer the SDK and license within Your company
(intra-company transfer), subject to the Intergraph Security, Government
& Infrastructure Software Transfer Policy (``SG&I Software Transfer
Policy'') and the terms of this License Agreement.  The SG&I Software
Transfer Policy is available from Intergraph upon request.  If You
transfer the SDK, You must at the same time either transfer all copies,
modifications, or merged portions, in whatever form, to the same party,
or You must destroy those not transferred

  3.	OBLIGATIONS AND RESTRICTIONS

 3.1.	Obligation to Support Both ECW and ECWP Read. You agree to: (i)
support ECW files within your Desktop Application as well as the reading
of ECWP streams so that each of Your Desktop Applications is capable of
displaying the ECW-format data and receiving streamed, compressed files
that adhere to the ECWP; and (ii) Your Desktop Applications must provide
a means for specifying or selecting an ECWP stream that is consistent
with the means for specifying or selecting other data sources in the
Desktop Application.  That is, if You create or distribute Desktop
Applications, each of those Desktop Applications must read ECW data and
ECWP streams and must allow a user to access the ECW data and ECWP
streams conveniently, with no more steps than is typical for access to
other data formats in Your Desktop Application.

 3.2.	No Reverse Engineering or Source Code Distribution.  Components of
the SDK used in Desktop Applications may be distributed for use in Your
organization only in object code or executable form. You shall not
decompile, disassemble or otherwise reverse-engineer the SDK in an
attempt to discover its source code, or distribute any source code of
the SDK.  Likewise, You must inform Your organizational end-users of the
prohibition from reverse-engineering the SDK.

 3.3.	License Requirements for Desktop Applications Created Using the
SDK. You shall distribute each of Your Desktop Applications to end-users
pursuant to a conspicuous, legally enforceable end-user license that
provides Intergraph with substantially the same protections as set forth
in Appendix A hereto.  You agree to take all necessary steps to ensure
the legal enforceability of the end-user license, including, as
appropriate: (i) offering a refund of at least a portion of the purchase
price of Your Desktop Applications to end-users who disagree with the
terms of the end-user license including the terms set forth in Appendix
A; or (ii) preventing downloading of Desktop Applications without
acceptance of the end-user license.  You also agree to take adequate
steps to prevent unauthorized use of the SDK or its derivatives by end
users who decline the end-user license offer, such as by disabling
access to Your Desktop Application or preventing access to features made
possible by the SDK, including Encoding or Decoding in Your Desktop
Application.

 3.4.	Intergraph Proprietary Rights Notice. You must include the
following statement of ownership/copyright notice in the ``About'' box
for each of Your Desktop Applications, or any other similar location
where You place proprietary rights notices pertaining to third party
software incorporated in the Desktop Application:

``This application supports the ECW data format and ECWP compression
protocols.  Portions of this computer program are Copyright 2007-2013
Intergraph Corporation. All rights reserved.  Creating compressed files
using ECW technology is protected by one or more of U.S. Patent No.
6,201,897, No. 6,442,298 and No. 6,633,688.''

 3.5.	Prohibition of other actions not explicitly permitted.  You are
not licensed to, and You agree to refrain from, any use, copying, or
distribution of the SDK, or the creation of derivative works thereof,
not explicitly permitted under this License Agreement and will pass on
this prohibition to Your end-users.

 3.6.	High Risk Use.  The SDK is not one hundred percent (100%)
fault-tolerant.  The SDK is not designed or intended for use in any
situation where failure or fault of any kind of the SDK could lead to
death or serious bodily injury of any person, or to severe physical,
property or environmental damage (``High Risk Use''). You are not
licensed to use the SDK in, or in conjunction with, any High Risk Use.
High Risk Use is STRICTLY PROHIBITED. High Risk Use includes, for
example, the following: operation of aircraft or other modes of human
mass transportation, nuclear or chemical facilities, and Class III
medical devices. You hereby agree not to use the SDK in, or in
connection with, any High Risk Use.

  3.7.	Hold Harmless. You shall hold harmless Intergraph from and
against any claims or lawsuits which arise or result from Your use of
the SDK, and/or the use or distribution of any Desktop Applications,
whether authorized under this License Agreement or not.

 4.	TERM AND TERMINATION

 4.1.	Term. The term of this License Agreement commences when you
install or use the SDK, and will extend until terminated.  You may
terminate this License Agreement at any time by permanently destroying
the SDK together with all copies, modifications and merged portions in
any form.  Intergraph may also immediately terminate this License
Agreement if You fail to comply with the terms and conditions of this
License Agreement, or if You fail to pay the appropriate license fees.
You agree upon the termination of this License Agreement to cease using
and to permanently destroy the SDK.

  4.2.	Termination for Breach. If You materially breach this License
Agreement and fail to cure that breach to Intergraph's satisfaction
within thirty (30) days after receiving written notice of the breach,
Intergraph shall have the right to terminate this License Agreement any
time after the end of such period.  Termination shall be without
prejudice to Intergraph's right to seek other redress, such as damages
or injunctive relief, for breach of this License Agreement.

 4.3.	Survival Provisions. Notwithstanding termination of this License
Agreement, Intergraph shall enjoy freedom from liability under Section
8; and Your liabilities for past breaches and Your hold harmless
obligations under Section 3.7 shall also survive.

 4.4.	Obligations Upon Termination. Upon termination of this License
Agreement, all licenses shall terminate and You must return to
Intergraph or destroy all copies of the SDK (and any copies,
modifications and merged portions of the SDK in any form, and all of the
component parts of the SDK) that are in Your possession, custody, or
control.

 5.	INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY.

	5.1	Ownership.

5.1.1	Software. SDKS ARE PROPRIETARY PRODUCTS OF INTERGRAPH AND
ADDITIONAL THIRD PARTIES, AND ARE PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT LAWS AND
INTERNATIONAL TREATIES. TITLE TO SDKS AND ALL COPIES, MODIFICATIONS AND
MERGED PORTIONS OF A SDKS SHALL AT ALL TIMES REMAIN WITH INTERGRAPH AND
SUCH THIRD PARTIES.  SDKs are licensed, not sold pursuant to this
License Agreement. Intergraph and additional third parties retain all
right, title and interest in and to all SDKs, including, but not limited
to, all Intellectual Property rights in and to each SDK. All rights not
expressly granted to You by this License Agreement or other applicable
third party software license agreement or terms and conditions are
reserved by Intergraph and such third parties.

5.1.2	Intellectual Property.  You acknowledge and agree that Intergraph
and third party manufacturers, as applicable, own all rights in and to
Intergraph's and the applicable third party manufacturer's trade names,
and no right or license is granted to You pursuant to this License
Agreement to use such trade names. You also acknowledge and agree that
Intergraph and third party manufacturers, as applicable, own all right,
title and interest in and to all intellectual property relating to and
for the SDK, including, without limitation, patents, trademarks,
copyrights, inventions (whether registerable or not), trade secrets,
concepts, ideas, methods, techniques, formulae, algorithms, logic
designs, screen displays, schematics, and source and object code
computer programs (collectively, ``Intellectual Property''). If You
bring a patent claim against Intergraph or any third party manufacturer
over patents You claim are being infringed by the SDK, Your patent
license from Intergraph and any applicable third party manufacturer(s)
for the SDK automatically ends.

5.2	Intellectual Property Infringement.

5.2.1	Remedy by Intergraph.  In the event the SDK is, in Intergraph's
opinion, likely to or becomes the subject of a claim of infringement of
any duly issued U.S. Intellectual Property, Intergraph may, at its sole
option and expense (a) procure for You the right to continue using the
SDK; (b) modify the SDK to make it non-infringing, but functionally the
same; (c) replace the SDK with an SDK which is non-infringing, but
functionally the same; or (d) provide a prorated refund to You of the
actual amount You paid Intergraph for the SDK.

5.2.2	Indemnification by You.  In the event any proceeding (suit, claim,
or action) is based (in whole or in part) on modifications, enhancements
or additions made by You or any person or entity on Your behalf, or Your
use of the SDK in combination with other products not furnished by
Intergraph, You agree to hold harmless and defend, at your sole cost and
expense, all of Intergraph's right, title and interest in and to the
SDK, as well as Intergraph's goodwill and reputation both in good faith
and at a standard as if the claim is made against You. You shall
reimburse Intergraph any defense expenses inclusive of reasonable
attorneys' fees expended by Intergraph in defense of said claim, and pay
any judgment rendered against Intergraph. You shall make such defense by
counsel of Your choosing and Intergraph shall reasonably cooperate with
said counsel at Your sole cost and expense. You shall have sole control
of said defense, but You shall allow Intergraph to reasonably
participate in its own defense and You shall reasonably cooperate with
Intergraph with respect to the settlement of any claim.  Notwithstanding
the foregoing, Intergraph may at any time decide to take over any
defense of Intergraph at Intergraph's cost and expense and You shall
render full cooperation and assistance to transfer such defense to
Intergraph and with respect to such defense.

5.3	DISCLAIMER OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY WARRANTIES AND LIMITATION OF
LIABILITY.  THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LIMITED WARRANTIES SET FORTH IN
THIS LICENSE AGREEMENT ARE IN LIEU OF ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED, RELATED TO INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY INFRINGEMENT AND THESE
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LIMITED WARRANTIES ALONG WITH THE STATED REMEDIES
REPRESENT THE FULL AND TOTAL WARRANTY OBLIGATION AND LIABILITY OF
INTERGRAPH WITH REGARD TO INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY INFRINGEMENT. THE
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LIMITED WARRANTIES PROVIDE YOU WITH SPECIFIC LEGAL
RIGHTS. YOU MAY HAVE OTHER RIGHTS, WHICH VARY FROM JURISDICTION TO
JURISDICTION. IF ANY PART OF THIS DISCLAIMER OF EXPRESS OR IMPLIED
WARRANTIES OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS RULED INVALID, THEN INTERGRAPH
DISCLAIMS EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND LIMITS ITS LIABILITY TO THE
MAXIMUM EXTENT ALLOWED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  IF A GREATER WARRANTY OR
LIABILITY IS MANDATED PURSUANT TO THE LAW HELD APPLICABLE TO THIS
AGREEMENT, THEN INTERGRAPH WARRANTS THE SDK AND PROVIDES LIABILITY TO
THE MINIMUM EXTENT REQUIRED BY SAID LAW.

 6.	LIMITED WARRANTIES.

6.1	Intergraph warrants to You for a period of thirty (30) days from the
date of shipment that the SDK delivery media will be free of defects in
material and workmanship, provided the SDK is used under normal
conditions and in strict accordance with the terms and conditions of
this License Agreement.  You agree to promptly notify Intergraph of any
unauthorized use, repair or modification, or misuse of the SDK, as well
as any suspected defect in the SDK delivery media.

6.2	Intergraph warrants that it has the right to grant you this license.

6.3	THE ABOVE LIMITED WARRANTIES ARE IN LIEU OF ALL OTHER WARRANTIES,
EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AND REPRESENT THE FULL WARRANTY OBLIGATION OF
INTERGRAPH. THE LIMITED WARRANTIES PROVIDE YOU WITH SPECIFIC LEGAL
RIGHTS. YOU MAY HAVE OTHER RIGHTS, WHICH VARY FROM JURISDICTION TO
JURISDICTION.  IF THIS WARRANTY SECTION DOES NOT ADHERE TO LOCAL LAWS,
THEN THE MINIMUM WARRANTY TERM PRESCRIBED BY THE LAWS OF YOUR
JURISDICTION SHALL APPLY.

 7.	WARRANTY DISCLAIMERS.

ALL WARRANTIES PROVIDED PURSUANT TO THIS LICENSE AGREEMENT ARE VOID IF
FAILURE OF A WARRANTED ITEM RESULTS DIRECTLY, OR INDIRECTLY, FROM AN
UNAUTHORIZED USE OR MISUSE OF A WARRANTED ITEM, INCLUDING, WITHOUT
LIMITATION, USE OF A WARRANTED ITEM UNDER ABNORMAL OPERATING CONDITIONS
OR UNAUTHORIZED MODIFICATION OR REPAIR OF A WARRANTED ITEM OR FAILURE TO
ROUTINELY MAINTAIN A WARRANTED ITEM. EXCEPT AS SPECIFICALLY SET FORTH IN
THIS LICENSE AGREEMENT, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE
LAW, INTERGRAPH AND ITS SUPPLIERS DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EITHER
EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, RELATING TO THE SDK, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE,
HIGH RISK USE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.  INTERGRAPH DOES NOT WARRANT THAT
THE SDK WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS, AND UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES DOES
INTERGRAPH WARRANT THAT THE SDK WILL OPERATE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR
FREE.  THE SDK IS PROVIDED ``AS IS'' AND YOU BEAR THE SOLE RISK OF USING
THE SDK. IF ANY PART OF THIS DISCLAIMER OF EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES
IS RULED INVALID, THEN INTERGRAPH DISCLAIMS EXPRESS OR IMPLIED
WARRANTIES TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT ALLOWED BY APPLICABLE LAW. IF A GREATER
WARRANTY OR LIABILITY IS MANDATED PURSUANT TO THE LAW HELD APPLICABLE TO
THIS AGREEMENT, THEN INTERGRAPH WARRANTS THE SDK AND PROVIDES LIABILITY
TO THE MINIMUM EXTENT REQUIRED BY SAID LAW.

 8.	LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

8.1	YOU ASSUME FULL AND COMPLETE LIABILITY FOR YOUR USE OF THE SDK. TO
THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL
INTERGRAPH OR ITS SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL,
INDIRECT, PUNITIVE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES WHATSOEVER (INCLUDING,
WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF USE OR PRODUCTION, LOSS OF
REVENUE OR PROFIT, LOSS OF DATA, LOSS OF BUSINESS INFORMATION, BUSINESS
INTERRUPTION, CLAIMS OF THIRD PARTIES OR ANY OTHER PECUNIARY LOSS)
ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT AND/OR THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE
SDK, EVEN IF INTERGRAPH HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGES.  INTERGRAPH'S ENTIRE LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION
WITH THIS LICENSE AGREEMENT SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT ACTUALLY PAID
BY YOU TO INTERGRAPH FOR THE SDK AT THE TIME THE INITIAL EVENT GIVING
RISE TO THE CLAIM OCCURS. EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE PROVIDED BY APPLICABLE
LAW, NO CLAIM, REGARDLESS OF FORM, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
LICENSE AGREEMENT MAY BE BROUGHT BY YOU MORE THAN ONE (1) YEAR FOLLOWING
THE INITIAL EVENT GIVING RISE TO THE CAUSE OF ACTION. BECAUSE SOME
JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY, THE
ABOVE LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.  IF ANY PART OF THIS SECTION IS
HELD INVALID, THEN INTERGRAPH LIMITS ITS LIABILITY TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT
ALLOWED BY APPLICABLE LAW.

8.1	In the event the SDK does not substantially comply with the limited
warranties set forth in this License Agreement, Intergraph's entire
liability and Your exclusive remedy shall be, in Intergraph's sole and
absolute discretion, either (i) the modification, repair or replacement
of the SDK; or (ii) a prorated refund to You of the actual amount You
paid Intergraph for the SDK for the period of time that the SDK did not
substantially conform to the limited warranties set forth in this
License Agreement.

8.2	Intergraph is acting on behalf of its suppliers for the sole purpose
of disclaiming, excluding and/or limiting obligations, warranties and
liability as provided in this License Agreement, but in no other
respects and for no other purpose.

 9.	AUDIT.

Intergraph shall have the right, during Your normal business hours, to
audit Your use of the SDK and Your compliance with the provisions of
this License Agreement.  Intergraph will provide You with thirty (30)
days prior written notice of an audit. The right of audit shall be
limited to twice per calendar year.  Prior to the start of an audit,
Intergraph's personnel will sign a reasonable non-disclosure agreement.
During the audit, You shall allow Intergraph's personnel to be provided
reasonable access to both Your records and personnel.  The cost of the
audit shall be paid by Intergraph unless the results of the audit
indicate that You have underpaid fees to Intergraph, in which case, You
agree to promptly pay Intergraph any differences in such fees associated
with your use that exceeds the license rights granted to you by the
License Agreement, and You further agree to bear all costs associated
with the audit.

 10.	RESTRICTIONS.

10.1	United States Government Restricted Rights.  If the SDK is
licensed, purchased, or obtained, directly or indirectly, by or on
behalf of a unit or agency of the United States Government, then this
Section 10.1 also applies.

10.1.1	For civilian agencies: The SDK was developed at private expense
and is ``restricted computer software'' submitted with restricted rights
in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulations (``FAR'')
52.227-19 (a) through (d) (Commercial Computer Software - Restricted

necessary to resolve the conflict.  You shall hold all information
concerning Beta Software and Your use and evaluation of such information

ANY KIND.  You may use the Beta Software only for evaluation and testing
and not for general production use.  You acknowledge that Intergraph has
not promised or guaranteed to you that Beta Software or any portion
thereof will be announced or made available to anyone in the future,
