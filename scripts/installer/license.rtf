\pard\sa283\qc\b0\fs24 Version 3, 29 June 2007\par

\pard\sa283 Copyright \'a9 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <{{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://fsf.org/"}}{\fldrslt{https://fsf.org/\ul0\cf0}}}}\f0\fs24 >\par
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\par

\pard\keepn\s3\sb140\sa120\tab\b\fs28 Preamble\par

\pard\sa283\b0\fs24 The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works.\par
The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to your programs, too.\par
When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.\par
To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\par
For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\par
Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\par
For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains that there is no warranty for this free software. For both users' and authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions.\par
Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users' freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products. If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\par
Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\par
The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.\par

\pard\keepn\s3\sb140\sa120\tab\b\fs28 TERMS AND CONDITIONS\par

\pard\keepn\s4\sb120\sa120\b0\fs24\tab\b 0. Definitions.\par

\pard\sa283\b0\ldblquote This License\rdblquote  refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\par
\ldblquote Copyright\rdblquote  also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.\par
\ldblquote The Program\rdblquote  refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License. Each licensee is addressed as \ldblquote you\rdblquote . \ldblquote Licensees\rdblquote  and \ldblquote recipients\rdblquote  may be individuals or organizations.\par
To \ldblquote modify\rdblquote  a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy. The resulting work is called a \ldblquote modified version\rdblquote  of the earlier work or a work \ldblquote based on\rdblquote  the earlier work.\par
A \ldblquote covered work\rdblquote  means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the Program.\par
To \ldblquote propagate\rdblquote  a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.\par
To \ldblquote convey\rdblquote  a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\par
An interactive user interface displays \ldblquote Appropriate Legal Notices\rdblquote  to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\par

\pard\keepn\s4\sb120\sa120\tab\b 1. Source Code.\par

\pard\sa283\b0 The \ldblquote source code\rdblquote  for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. \ldblquote Object code\rdblquote  means any non-source form of a work.\par
A \ldblquote Standard Interface\rdblquote  means an interface that either is an official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among developers working in that language.\par
The \ldblquote System Libraries\rdblquote  of an executable work include anything, other than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code form. A \ldblquote Major Component\rdblquote , in this context, means a major essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\par
The \ldblquote Corresponding Source\rdblquote  for a work in object code form means all the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities. However, it does not include the work's System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated with source files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work.\par
The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.\par
The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work.\par

\pard\keepn\s4\sb120\sa120\tab\b 2. Basic Permissions.\par

\pard\sa283\b0 All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\par
You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force. You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\par
Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary.\par

\pard\keepn\s4\sb120\sa120\tab\b 3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\par

\pard\sa283\b0 No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.\par
When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures.\par

\pard\keepn\s4\sb120\sa120\tab\b 4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\par

\pard\sa283\b0 You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\par
You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\par

\pard\keepn\s4\sb120\sa120\tab\b 5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\par

\pard\sa283\b0 You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\par

\pard{\pntext\f3\'B7\tab}{\*\pn\pnlvlblt\pnf3\pnindent0{\pntxtb\'B7}}\fi-283\li707\tx707 a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and giving a relevant date. \par
{\pntext\f3\'B7\tab}b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under this License and any conditions added under section 7. This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to \ldblquote keep intact all notices\rdblquote . \par
{\pntext\f3\'B7\tab}c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have separately received it. \par

\pard{\pntext\f3\'B7\tab}{\*\pn\pnlvlblt\pnf3\pnindent0{\pntxtb\'B7}}\fi-283\li707\sa283\tx707 d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need not make them do so. \par

\pard\sa283 A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an \ldblquote aggregate\rdblquote  if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.\par

\pard\keepn\s4\sb120\sa120\tab\b 6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\par

\pard\sa283\b0 You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these ways:\par

\pard{\pntext\f3\'B7\tab}{\*\pn\pnlvlblt\pnf3\pnindent0{\pntxtb\'B7}}\fi-283\li707\tx707 a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange. \par
{\pntext\f3\'B7\tab}b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge. \par
{\pntext\f3\'B7\tab}c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b. \par
{\pntext\f3\'B7\tab}d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party) that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements. \par

\pard{\pntext\f3\'B7\tab}{\*\pn\pnlvlblt\pnf3\pnindent0{\pntxtb\'B7}}\fi-283\li707\sa283\tx707 e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no charge under subsection 6d. \par

\pard\sa283 A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in conveying the object code work.\par
A \ldblquote User Product\rdblquote  is either (1) a \ldblquote consumer product\rdblquote , which means any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular product received by a particular user, \ldblquote normally used\rdblquote  refers to a typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product. A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only significant mode of use of the product.\par
\ldblquote Installation Information\rdblquote  for a User Product means any methods, procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The information must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because modification has been made.\par
If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).\par
The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a network may be denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for communication across the network.\par
Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented (and with an implementation available to the public in source code form), and must require no special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.\par

\pard\keepn\s4\sb120\sa120\tab\b 7. Additional Terms.\par

\pard\sa283\b0\ldblquote Additional permissions\rdblquote  are terms that supplement the terms of this License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to the additional permissions.\par
When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it. (Additional permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\par
Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\par

\pard{\pntext\f3\'B7\tab}{\*\pn\pnlvlblt\pnf3\pnindent0{\pntxtb\'B7}}\fi-283\li707\tx707 a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or \par
{\pntext\f3\'B7\tab}b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by works containing it; or \par
{\pntext\f3\'B7\tab}c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in reasonable ways as different from the original version; or \par
{\pntext\f3\'B7\tab}d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors of the material; or \par
{\pntext\f3\'B7\tab}e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or \par

\pard{\pntext\f3\'B7\tab}{\*\pn\pnlvlblt\pnf3\pnindent0{\pntxtb\'B7}}\fi-283\li707\sa283\tx707 f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors. \par

\pard\sa283 All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \ldblquote further restrictions\rdblquote  within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License along with a term that is a further restriction, you may remove that term. If a license document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of that license document, provided that the further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying.\par
If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms.\par
Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements apply either way.\par

\pard\keepn\s4\sb120\sa120\tab\b 8. Termination.\par

\pard\sa283\b0 You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11).\par
However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.\par
Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.\par
Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10.\par

\pard\keepn\s4\sb120\sa120\tab\b 9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\par

\pard\sa283\b0 You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However, nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\par

\pard\keepn\s4\sb120\sa120\tab\b 10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\par

\pard\sa283\b0 Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\par
An \ldblquote entity transaction\rdblquote  is a transaction transferring control of an organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\par
You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\par

\pard\keepn\s4\sb120\sa120\tab\b 11. Patents.\par

\pard\sa283\b0 A \ldblquote contributor\rdblquote  is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work thus licensed is called the contributor's \ldblquote contributor version\rdblquote .\par
A contributor's \ldblquote essential patent claims\rdblquote  are all patent claims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor version. For purposes of this definition, \ldblquote control\rdblquote  includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License.\par
Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version.\par
In the following three paragraphs, a \ldblquote patent license\rdblquote  is any express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement). To \ldblquote grant\rdblquote  such a patent license to a party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.\par
If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available network server or other readily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream recipients. \ldblquote Knowingly relying\rdblquote  means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid.\par
If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it.\par
A patent license is \ldblquote discriminatory\rdblquote  if it does not include within the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this License. You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\par
Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\par

\pard\keepn\s4\sb120\sa120\tab\b 12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\par

\pard\sa283\b0 If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\par

\pard\keepn\s4\sb120\sa120\tab\b 13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\par

\pard\sa283\b0 Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work. The terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License, section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the combination as such.\par

\pard\keepn\s4\sb120\sa120\tab\b 14. Revised Versions of this License.\par

\pard\sa283\b0 The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\par
Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public License \ldblquote or any later version\rdblquote  applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\par
If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.\par
Later license versions may give you additional or different permissions. However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version.\par

\pard\keepn\s4\sb120\sa120\tab\b 15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\par

\pard\sa283\b0 THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \ldblquote AS IS\rdblquote  WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

\pard\keepn\s3\sb140\sa120\tab\b\fs28 How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\par

\pard\sa283\b0\fs24 If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\par
To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the \ldblquote copyright\rdblquote  line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\par

\pard\f1\fs20     <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\par

    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\par
    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\par
    (at your option) any later version.\par
\par
    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\par
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\par

\par
    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\par

\pard\sa283     along with this program.  If not, see <{{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.gnu.org/licenses/"}}{\fldrslt{https://www.gnu.org/licenses/\ul0\cf0}}}}\f1\fs20 >.\par
\f0\fs24 Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\par
If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\par

\pard\f1\fs20     <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\par
    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\par
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\par

\pard\sa283     under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\par
\f0\fs24 The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, your program's commands might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an \ldblquote about box\rdblquote .\par
You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school, if any, to sign a \ldblquote copyright disclaimer\rdblquote  for the program, if necessary. For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see <{\f1{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.gnu.org/licenses/"}}{\fldrslt{https://www.gnu.org/licenses/\ul0\cf0}}}}\f0\fs24 >.\par
The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General Public License instead of this License. But first, please read <{\f1{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.gnu.org/licenses/why-not-lgpl.html"}}{\fldrslt{https://www.gnu.org/licenses/why-not-lgpl.html\ul0\cf0}}}}\f0\fs24 >.\par

\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1 ========================================================================= ERDAS ECW/JP2 Desktop Read-Only Redistributable SDK License Agreement IMPORTANT - READ CAREFULLY: This ERDAS ECW/JP2 Desktop Read-Only Redistributable SDK License Agreement ("License Agreement") is a legal agreement between You (either an individual or a single legal entity) and Intergraph Corporation d/b/a Security, Government & Infrastructure Division (``Intergraph''), for the SDK delivered with this License Agreement. By installing, copying, downloading, accessing or otherwise using the SDK, You agree to be bound by the terms of this License Agreement, which shall take precedence over any other document and shall govern Your use of the SDK. If You do not agree to the terms of this License Agreement, do not install or use the SDK. You agree that this License Agreement is enforceable against You the same as any written, negotiated contract signed by You. If You do not agree to the terms of this License Agreement, You are not authorized to, and You shall not, download, install or use the SDK. 1. DEFINITIONS 1.1. ``Decode'' means to view files compressed either using ECW or JPEG2000 technology. 1.2. ``Desktop Application'' means desktop software products that You develop and that permit an end-user to Decode (among other functionality You develop), and that are intended to be used as self-contained programs for displaying and processing imagery on the same computing device. 1.3. ``ECW'' stands for Enhanced Compressed Wavelet. 1.4. ``ECWP'' is the Enhanced Compressed Wavelet Protocol, by which ECW and JPEG2000 files residing on a Server may be streamed to a Desktop Application and Decoded using the SDK. 1.5. ``Encode'' means to compress data using ECW technology or to otherwise compress using the SDK. 1.6. ``Library'' means file of computing functions, compiled, linked, and saved separately from the processes that use them, intended for use by programmers in connection with their development of applications that use the library. 1.7. ``SDK'' means the Software Development Kit, that is, the set of software development tools designed to facilitate development of Desktop Applications using the SDK technologies, currently marketed and licensed by Intergraph as ECW/JP2 Desktop Read-Only Redistributable SDK, version 5.0 or higher, consisting of libraries and supporting documents designed to enable You to write software that enables You as the end-user to Decode files but not to Encode files. Among other things, the SDK enables reading ECWP streams and enables decompression of files having an *.ecw and *.jp2 extension. The SDK includes the computer software, object code copy and all contents of the files, disks, CD-ROMs or other media with which this License Agreement is provided, including any templates, printed materials, and online or electronic documentation, all copies, and any modified versions, enhancements, fixes, patches, updates, and upgrades of the SDK, if any, licensed to You by Intergraph, unless a particular modified version, enhancement, fix, patch, update, or upgrade is accompanied by a different license agreement, in which case that license shall apply in accordance with its terms. No source code is included with the SDK. 1.8. ``Server'' means a computing device in a network that is used to provide services (such as access to files or shared peripherals or any other computing function) to other computing devices in the network. 1.9. ``Server Application'' means software products that You develop or maintain and are capable of running on a Server to provide an image decoding or processing capability. This License Agreement does not authorize You to use the SDK to create Server Applications. 2. LICENSE TO CREATE DESKTOP APPLICATIONS; PROHIBITED DEVELOPMENT; APPLICABILITY TO UPGRADES; NO SUPPORT OBLIGATION 2.1. Subject to Your ongoing compliance with all of the terms of this License Agreement, You are hereby granted a nonexclusive, limited, royalty-free license to use the SDK to create, use and distribute a Desktop Application that Decodes files of any size but does not Encode. You assume full responsibility for the implementation of the SDK to achieve Your intended results, and for the installation, use and results obtained from the SDK. 2.2. For avoidance of doubt, this License Agreement does not permit You to (a) create and distribute Server Applications that include the SDK; or; (b) distribute files that are not included in the ``redistributables'' directory of the SDK. 2.3. This Agreement applies to the original SDK received by You, and to any bug fixes, updates, upgrades, modifications or enhancements provided to You by Intergraph, unless a particular bug fix, update, upgrade, modification or enhancement is accompanied by a different license agreement, in which case that license shall apply in accordance with its terms. 2.4. This License Agreement does not entitle You to, and Intergraph undertakes no obligation to provide, maintenance, support, modified versions, enhancements, fixes, patches, updates, and upgrades to the SDK. Any support, maintenance or similar services that Intergraph makes available would be provided under a separate agreement. 2.5. You may make one copy of the SDK media in machine readable or printed form and solely for backup purposes. Intergraph retains ownership of all created copies. You may not transfer the rights to a backup copy unless you transfer all rights in the SDK and license as provided for in Section 2.6. 2.6. You may transfer the SDK and license within Your company (intra-company transfer), subject to the Intergraph Security, Government & Infrastructure Software Transfer Policy (``SG&I Software Transfer Policy'') and the terms of this License Agreement. The SG&I Software Transfer Policy is available from Intergraph upon request. If You transfer the SDK, You must at the same time either transfer all copies, modifications, or merged portions, in whatever form, to the same party, or You must destroy those not transferred 3. OBLIGATIONS AND RESTRICTIONS 3.1. Obligation to Support Both ECW and ECWP Read. You agree to: (i) support ECW files within your Desktop Application as well as the reading of ECWP streams so that each of Your Desktop Applications is capable of displaying the ECW-format data and receiving streamed, compressed files that adhere to the ECWP; and (ii) Your Desktop Applications must provide a means for specifying or selecting an ECWP stream that is consistent with the means for specifying or selecting other data sources in the Desktop Application. That is, if You create or distribute Desktop Applications, each of those Desktop Applications must read ECW data and ECWP streams and must allow a user to access the ECW data and ECWP streams conveniently, with no more steps than is typical for access to other data formats in Your Desktop Application. 3.2. No Reverse Engineering or Source Code Distribution. Components of the SDK used in Desktop Applications may be distributed for use in Your organization only in object code or executable form. You shall not decompile, disassemble or otherwise reverse-engineer the SDK in an attempt to discover its source code, or distribute any source code of the SDK. Likewise, You must inform Your organizational end-users of the prohibition from reverse-engineering the SDK. 3.3. License Requirements for Desktop Applications Created Using the SDK. You shall distribute each of Your Desktop Applications to end-users pursuant to a conspicuous, legally enforceable end-user license that provides Intergraph with substantially the same protections as set forth in Appendix A hereto. You agree to take all necessary steps to ensure the legal enforceability of the end-user license, including, as appropriate: (i) offering a refund of at least a portion of the purchase price of Your Desktop Applications to end-users who disagree with the terms of the end-user license including the terms set forth in Appendix A; or (ii) preventing downloading of Desktop Applications without acceptance of the end-user license. You also agree to take adequate steps to prevent unauthorized use of the SDK or its derivatives by end users who decline the end-user license offer, such as by disabling access to Your Desktop Application or preventing access to features made possible by the SDK, including Encoding or Decoding in Your Desktop Application. 3.4. Intergraph Proprietary Rights Notice. You must include the following statement of ownership/copyright notice in the ``About'' box for each of Your Desktop Applications, or any other similar location where You place proprietary rights notices pertaining to third party software incorporated in the Desktop Application: ``This application supports the ECW data format and ECWP compression protocols. Portions of this computer program are Copyright 2007-2013 Intergraph Corporation. All rights reserved. Creating compressed files using ECW technology is protected by one or more of U.S. Patent No. 6,201,897, No. 6,442,298 and No. 6,633,688.'' 3.5. Prohibition of other actions not explicitly permitted. You are not licensed to, and You agree to refrain from, any use, copying, or distribution of the SDK, or the creation of derivative works thereof, not explicitly permitted under this License Agreement and will pass on this prohibition to Your end-users. 3.6. High Risk Use. The SDK is not one hundred percent (100%) fault-tolerant. The SDK is not designed or intended for use in any situation where failure or fault of any kind of the SDK could lead to death or serious bodily injury of any person, or to severe physical, property or environmental damage (``High Risk Use''). You are not licensed to use the SDK in, or in conjunction with, any High Risk Use. High Risk Use is STRICTLY PROHIBITED. High Risk Use includes, for example, the following: operation of aircraft or other modes of human mass transportation, nuclear or chemical facilities, and Class III medical devices. You hereby agree not to use the SDK in, or in connection with, any High Risk Use. 3.7. Hold Harmless. You shall hold harmless Intergraph from and against any claims or lawsuits which arise or result from Your use of the SDK, and/or the use or distribution of any Desktop Applications, whether authorized under this License Agreement or not. 4. TERM AND TERMINATION 4.1. Term. The term of this License Agreement commences when you install or use the SDK, and will extend until terminated. You may terminate this License Agreement at any time by permanently destroying the SDK together with all copies, modifications and merged portions in any form. Intergraph may also immediately terminate this License Agreement if You fail to comply with the terms and conditions of this License Agreement, or if You fail to pay the appropriate license fees. You agree upon the termination of this License Agreement to cease using and to permanently destroy the SDK. 4.2. Termination for Breach. If You materially breach this License Agreement and fail to cure that breach to Intergraph's satisfaction within thirty (30) days after receiving written notice of the breach, Intergraph shall have the right to terminate this License Agreement any time after the end of such period. Termination shall be without prejudice to Intergraph's right to seek other redress, such as damages or injunctive relief, for breach of this License Agreement. 4.3. Survival Provisions. Notwithstanding termination of this License Agreement, Intergraph shall enjoy freedom from liability under Section 8; and Your liabilities for past breaches and Your hold harmless obligations under Section 3.7 shall also survive. 4.4. Obligations Upon Termination. Upon termination of this License Agreement, all licenses shall terminate and You must return to Intergraph or destroy all copies of the SDK (and any copies, modifications and merged portions of the SDK in any form, and all of the component parts of the SDK) that are in Your possession, custody, or control. 5. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. 5.1 Ownership. 5.1.1 Software. SDKS ARE PROPRIETARY PRODUCTS OF INTERGRAPH AND ADDITIONAL THIRD PARTIES, AND ARE PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT LAWS AND INTERNATIONAL TREATIES. TITLE TO SDKS AND ALL COPIES, MODIFICATIONS AND MERGED PORTIONS OF A SDKS SHALL AT ALL TIMES REMAIN WITH INTERGRAPH AND SUCH THIRD PARTIES. SDKs are licensed, not sold pursuant to this License Agreement. Intergraph and additional third parties retain all right, title and interest in and to all SDKs, including, but not limited to, all Intellectual Property rights in and to each SDK. All rights not expressly granted to You by this License Agreement or other applicable third party software license agreement or terms and conditions are reserved by Intergraph and such third parties. 5.1.2 Intellectual Property.

If You bring a patent claim against Intergraph or any third party manufacturer over patents You claim are being infringed by the SDK, Your patent license from Intergraph and any applicable third party manufacturer(s) for the SDK automatically ends. 5.2 Intellectual Property Infringement. 5.2.1 Remedy by Intergraph. In the event the SDK is, in Intergraph's opinion, likely to or becomes the subject of a claim of infringement of any duly issued U.S. Intellectual Property, Intergraph may, at its sole option and expense (a) procure for You the right to continue using the SDK; (b) modify the SDK to make it non-infringing, but functionally the same; (c) replace the SDK with an SDK which is non-infringing, but functionally the same; or (d) provide a prorated refund to You of the actual amount You paid Intergraph for the SDK. 5.2.2 Indemnification by You. In the event any proceeding (suit, claim, or action) is based (in whole or in part) on modifications, enhancements or additions made by You or any person or entity on Your behalf, or Your use of the SDK in combination with other products not furnished by Intergraph, You agree to hold harmless and defend, at your sole cost and expense, all of Intergraph's right, title and interest in and to the SDK, as well as Intergraph's goodwill and reputation both in good faith and at a standard as if the claim is made against You. You shall reimburse Intergraph any defense expenses inclusive of reasonable attorneys' fees expended by Intergraph in defense of said claim, and pay any judgment rendered against Intergraph. You shall make such defense by counsel of Your choosing and Intergraph shall reasonably cooperate with said counsel at Your sole cost and expense. You shall have sole control of said defense, but You shall allow Intergraph to reasonably participate in its own defense and You shall reasonably cooperate with Intergraph with respect to the settlement of any claim. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Intergraph may at any time decide to take over any defense of Intergraph at Intergraph's cost and expense and You shall render full cooperation and assistance to transfer such defense to Intergraph and with respect to such defense. 5.3 DISCLAIMER OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY WARRANTIES AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LIMITED WARRANTIES SET FORTH IN THIS LICENSE AGREEMENT ARE IN LIEU OF ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, RELATED TO INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY INFRINGEMENT AND THESE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LIMITED WARRANTIES ALONG WITH THE STATED REMEDIES REPRESENT THE FULL AND TOTAL WARRANTY OBLIGATION AND LIABILITY OF INTERGRAPH WITH REGARD TO INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY INFRINGEMENT. THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LIMITED WARRANTIES PROVIDE YOU WITH SPECIFIC LEGAL RIGHTS. YOU MAY HAVE OTHER RIGHTS, WHICH VARY FROM JURISDICTION TO JURISDICTION. IF ANY PART OF THIS DISCLAIMER OF EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS RULED INVALID, THEN INTERGRAPH DISCLAIMS EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND LIMITS ITS LIABILITY TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT ALLOWED BY APPLICABLE LAW. IF A GREATER WARRANTY OR LIABILITY IS MANDATED PURSUANT TO THE LAW HELD APPLICABLE TO THIS AGREEMENT, THEN INTERGRAPH WARRANTS THE SDK AND PROVIDES LIABILITY TO THE MINIMUM EXTENT REQUIRED BY SAID LAW. 6.

THE BETA SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED TO YOU ``AS-IS'', AND INTERGRAPH DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTY AND LIABILITY OBLIGATIONS TO YOU OF ANY KIND. You may use the Beta Software only for evaluation and testing and not for general production use. You acknowledge that Intergraph has not promised or guaranteed to you that Beta Software or any portion thereof will be announced or made available to anyone in the future, Intergraph has no express or implied obligation to You to announce or introduce the Beta Software and that Intergraph may not introduce a product similar to or compatible with the Beta Software. Accordingly, You acknowledge that any research or development that You perform regarding the Beta Software or any product associated with the Beta Software is done entirely at Your own risk. During the term of this License Agreement, if requested by Intergraph, You will provide feedback to Intergraph regarding Beta Testing, including error or bug reports. Upon receipt of a later unreleased version of Beta Software or release by Intergraph of a publicly released commercial version of the SDK, You agree to return or permanently destroy all earlier Beta Software received from Intergraph.
